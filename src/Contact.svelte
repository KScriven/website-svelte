  <h2>How to shoot the breeze with me</h2>
</header>
<p><b>Fact:</b> I have non-existent facebook, twitter, instagram, snapchat, [fill in more here ... ] accounts 
  <p>Whilst this means I am not always up to date with the latest <i>thing</i>... I am happy to sacrifice that for more focussed time spent online</p>
<p>You are welcome to email me at <b> {email} </b> or find me on <a href={linkedIn} target="_blank"><b>LinkedIn</b></a></p>
<p>Learning to code is hard work so you can keep me motivated by <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kerryn" target="_blank"><b>buying me a coffee \~/</b></a></p>
